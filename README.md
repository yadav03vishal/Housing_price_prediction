# Housing Price Prediction using XGBoost

## Overview
This project involves predicting housing prices using the `housing.csv` dataset and the XGBoost machine learning model. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation, with a comparison of results before and after removing outliers.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - The main notebook file is `HOUSING_PRICE_PREDICTION.ipynb`. This notebook contains all the necessary code for loading the data, preprocessing, training the XGBoost model, and evaluating the results.

2. **Upload the Dataset**:
   - Upload the `housing.csv` file into the Colab environment.
   - You can do this by clicking the "Files" tab on the left-hand side of the Colab interface and uploading the `housing.csv` file from your local machine.

3. **Run the Entire Notebook**:
   - Once the CSV file is uploaded, go to the Colab menu:
     - Click on **"Runtime"** â†’ **"Run all"** to execute all the cells in the notebook.
   - The notebook will automatically read the CSV file, preprocess the data, train the model, and display results.

## Dependencies
All required libraries (e.g., `xgboost`, `sklearn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) are pre-installed in Google Colab, so **no installation is required**.

## Summary
- The notebook compares model performance with and without outliers, and hyperparameters are optimized for the XGBoost model using grid search.
- The project concludes that keeping the outliers in this dataset yields better performance due to the valuable information carried by high-value data points.

## Instructions for Use
1. Make sure to upload the `housing.csv` dataset.
2. Run the entire notebook from the **"Runtime"** menu.
3. Review the results and analysis in the output cells to understand how the model was trained and evaluated.
